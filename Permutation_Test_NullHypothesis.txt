Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)
Age and bone_density are assumed to be NEGATIVELY correlated. 
Implement a permutation test for the hypothesis of a null correlation. 
The function pearson_r()is already in your namespace. 
Complete the code to return the output 

# Compute observed correlation
obs = pearson_r(age,bone_density)
# Draw repl. of correlation
reps = np.empty(10000)
for i in range(10000):
    age_perm = np.random.permutation(age)
    reps[i] = pearson_r(age_perm,bone_density)
# Compute and print p-value
p = np.sum(reps <= obs) / len(reps)
print('p-value =', p)

Output: p-value = 0.0001
